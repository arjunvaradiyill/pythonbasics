## Introduction to Python

Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability. It is widely used in various fields, including web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing, and more.

## Setting Up Your Environment

To get started with Python, you'll need to set up your development environment. Follow these steps:

1. **Install Python**: Download and install the latest version of Python from the official website [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. **Install an IDE or Text Editor**: Choose an Integrated Development Environment (IDE) or a text editor to write your code. Popular options include:
   - [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/)
   - [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
   - [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/)
3. **Verify Installation**: Open a terminal or command prompt and type `python --version` to verify that Python is installed correctly.

## Python Syntax and Basics

### Variables and Data Types

In Python, variables are used to store data values. Here's a quick overview of different data types:

- **Integer**: `int`
- **Floating-point**: `float`
- **String**: `str`
- **Boolean**: `bool`

Example:
```python
# Integer
age = 25

# Floating-point
height = 5.9

# String
name = "John"

# Boolean
is_student = True
